# Django TravelMathLite Critique — Modular Design and Scalability  
*Tan Vu | CIDM 6325 Weeks 7–8*

### Strengths  
- **App separation:** `routes`, `analytics`, and `users` each encapsulate a distinct business function.  
- **Service abstraction:** Distance calculations isolated in utility modules demonstrate reusable design.  
- **CBV usage:** Trip List and Trip Detail views inherit cleanly, promoting a scalable pattern.

### Limitations  
- **Implicit coupling:** Some logic resides inside views rather than a dedicated service layer, blurring separation.  
- **Testing depth:** Few explicit unit tests for route calculations; mocks would improve reliability.  
- **Monolithic URLs:** A single urls.py file could be split into per-app namespaces.

### Recommendations  
1. Introduce a `core.services` module for shared logic.  
2. Use Mixin inheritance for repeated CBV behaviors (e.g., permission checks).  
3. Expand CI coverage to include static analysis and test execution.

### Conclusion  
TravelMathLite exemplifies sound modular principles and demonstrates how CBVs unify structure and scalability. With a lightweight service layer and expanded testing, it could evolve from a teaching demo to a robust production framework.
